- All existing writing prompts will contain blacklisted words not to include in the generated outputs
  - These words to avoid will be included in the prompt as well as in the reference files of the Salina Instructbots themselves
  - "Words to Avoid" reference file: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGBfDt5DIKr5A5eYwNiKmvGQOEG9dIMU/view?usp=sharing
- All existing writing prompts will also include "no yapping" as part of the prompt
  - This segment in the prompt will reduce the length of the agents' outputs
  - It also aims to make the outputs less GPT sounding
