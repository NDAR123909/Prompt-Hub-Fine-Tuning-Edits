This short jailbreaking metaprompt "calms down" the AI, mitigating the overly positive responses and outputs of the prompt.

## New Additions

- Metaprompt added to the caption style prompts to maintain a balanced and neutral tone in both responses and outputs
  - Changes were reflected in both the Prompt Hub Database and the main Salina Prompt Hub page

## Removed 

- Removed existing metaprompt instructing the agents to reply with a positive (among other things) tone
  - Replaced with the "neutral and balanced" metaprompt instead
